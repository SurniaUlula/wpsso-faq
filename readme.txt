Create FAQ and Question / Answer Pages with optional shortcodes to include FAQs and Questions / Answers in your content.

== Description ==

<p style="margin:0;"><img class="readme-icon" src="https://surniaulula.github.io/wpsso-faq/assets/icon-256x256.png"></p>

The WPSSO FAQ Manager allows you to easily manage Questions / Answers from a standard WordPress Question editing page. You can also categorize your Questions / Answers into FAQ categories, just like standard WordPress Posts.

Use the standard WordPress FAQ category archive and question pages, and/or use `[faq]` and `[question]` shortcode(s) in your Post / Page content -- both will automatically reflect any change your make to your Questions / Answers or FAQ categories (ie. adding / removing questions, updating answers, etc.).

**Optional:**

If you need **Schema FAQPage** markup for the FAQ shortcode or FAQ categories you create, you will also need the [WPSSO Schema JSON-LD Markup add-on](https://wordpress.org/plugins/wpsso-schema-json-ld/) to generate the Schema FAQPage markup. The WPSSO FAQ Manager add-on manages Question / Answer pages and FAQ categories - it does not create Schema markup or meta tags.

**Optional:**

If you need to adjust the default FAQ category archive page layout, see the [WordPress Theme Handbook &gt; Custom Taxonomy section](https://developer.wordpress.org/themes/template-files-section/taxonomy-templates/#custom-taxonomy) for details on creating a new FAQ category archive page template based on your current theme archive page template.
